## Project Overview

This repository contains a **static frontend clone** of the Apple Store website, developed as a semester project for **Introduction to Computing Technologies (ICT)**.

The goal was to practice fundamental web development skills by recreating the clean, modern, and premium look & feel of Apple's official online store using only HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript.

**Key Highlights**:
- Responsive homepage with hero section and product highlights
- Emphasis on Apple's latest products (iPhone 16, MacBook, iPad Pro, Apple Watch, AirPods, Vision Pro)
- Minimalist design inspired by Apple's signature style: plenty of white space, elegant typography, and high-quality product focus

## Features (Current)

- Hero banner welcoming users to the Apple Store
- Product showcase sections with descriptions of latest Apple devices
- "View All Products" call-to-action link
- Clean and modern layout
- Fully static – no backend required
- Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access
